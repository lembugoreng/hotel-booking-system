# Hotel Booking System
This project is multi-faceted and incorporates various modern technologies to facilitate an engaging and efficient user experience.

On the client-side, we're using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the backbone of our web application, structuring our content in a meaningful and accessible way. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), on the other hand, is used to create a visually appealing interface, controlling layout, color schemes, fonts, and other aesthetic aspects of the site. We're using JavaScript to add dynamic and interactive features, enhancing user interaction and overall user experience.

For the server-side, we have chosen PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor). PHP is a popular server-side scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It enables us to create dynamic web pages that can interact with databases, and it offers excellent compatibility with various types of databases.

Our choice of database technology is MySQL, an open-source relational database management system. MySQL is renowned for its speed, scalability, and reliability. It offers comprehensive support for PHP, ensuring seamless interaction between our server-side scripting and the database.

To handle transactions on our web application, we're integrating the Stripe API to serve as our payment gateway. Stripe is a robust and secure platform for handling online payments. It supports processing payments in a wide variety of methods, from credit cards to digital wallets, and it also provides tools for managing subscriptions, fraud prevention, and more. This allows us to offer our users a safe, convenient, and versatile payment solution.
